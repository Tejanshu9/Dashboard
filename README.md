Admin Dashboard Interface
This project is a simple, modern administration dashboard built using plain HTML and CSS, designed to showcase key user data, project summaries, and communication elements.

Features

Persistent Sidebar: A blue sidebar provides clear navigation links for core dashboard sections (Home, Profiles, Tasks, Settings, etc.).

Dynamic Header: Includes a search bar, user profile information, and quick action buttons (New, Upload, Share).

Project Cards: Displays current projects in a card-based format with title, description, and interaction icons (star, view, share).

Information Panels: Dedicated sections for real-time Announcements and Trending topics/users.

Structure
The dashboard is structured into two main components:

Sidebar (.sidebar): Fixed navigation column.

Main Content (.main-content): A grid area divided into a 3/1 ratio for Projects and Info Panels (Announcements/Trending).
